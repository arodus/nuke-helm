# Contribution Guidelines

It is important to understand [our philosophy](https://nuke.build/docs/getting-started/philosophy.html). Of course we're grateful for any type of contribution or feedback. NUKE is a free open-source project, with the goal that many developers will benefit from it. Nevertheless, we do have several expectations on participation:

- [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) must be followed at any time
- Issue authors are required to become a [stargazer](https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke/stargazers)
- Bug reports must include information about the _actual behavior_, _expected behavior_ and _used versions_
- Issues related to [unsupported tools](https://nuke.build/docs/authoring-builds/cli-tools.html#unsupported-tools) or [missing arguments](https://nuke.build/docs/authoring-builds/cli-tools.html#note-1) are not accepted anymore; given the declarative code-generation approach, we expect pull-requests instead
- Pull-requests don't imply any requirements yet, but we do recommend getting in touch first
